He also blamed the opposition for spreading lies about the bills.\n                      <br/>\n                      <br/>\n                      Let's further implore the reason behind these sentiments.\n                      <br/>\n                      <br/>\n                      \n                      \n                      \n                      <h4> Word Cloud of Positive Sentiments (Supporters) </h4><br/><p style={{textAlign:\"center\"}}>\n                      <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thedatanecdotes/FarmersProtest/main/Images/pcloud.png\" /></p><br/>\n                      <br/>\n                      \n                      On studying the word cloud , the following conclusions were drawn for people for the bill:\n                      <ul>\n                            <li> That the laws should be supported</li>\n                            <li> There are talks amongst them for the influence of cartels in mandis </li>\n                            <li> The farmers are being influenced by the opposition parties </li>\n                            \n                      </ul>\n                              \n                      <h4> Word Cloud for Negative Sentiments (Opposers) </h4><br/><p style={{textAlign:\"center\"}}>\n                      <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thedatanecdotes/FarmersProtest/main/Images/ncloud.png\" /></p><br/>\n                      <br/>\n                      \n                      On studying the word cloud, the following conclusions were drawn for people against the bill:\n                      <ul>\n                            <li> Implementing these laws would insure the existence of cartels outside of APMC </li>\n                            <li> The highest prices would be set by the cartels and not by the farmers </li>\n                            <li> The government isn't corporating with the farmers </li>\n                      </ul>\n                      \n                      <br/>\n                      <br/>\n\n                      <p style={{fontWeight:\"bold\",textAlign:\"center\"}}>For Datasets and Python Scripts which entail how we did it , visit our Github.<br/><br/>\n                      <Button variant=\"danger\" href=\"https://github.com/thedatanecdotes/FarmersProtest\">Visit Github</Button></p>\n      \n                    </p>\n                </Jumbotron>\n              </Container>\n            </div>    \n           </>\n  )\n}\n\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
